I built Scraper class, Ingredients class and Directions class.

I wrote the parser for ingredients extracting name, quantity, measurement, descriptor, preparation and transformed_method,
and the parser for directions extracting tools, primary cooking methods, other cooking methods, times and steps.

I wrote scrape_title, scrape_ingredients, scrape_directions, scrape_unit, scrape_primarycookingmethods,
scrape_cookingmethods and scrape_tools in Scraper class.

I tested and debugged when we finalized our code.
