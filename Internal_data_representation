Class of Ingredients   -    6 attributes:
- name
- quantity
- measurement
- descriptor
- preparation
- transformed_method

Each ingredient sentence is parsed into the Ingredients class. Then name, quantity, measurement, descriptor, preparation are
extracted and assigned to the right attributes. If any information is not available, 'none' is assigned to the corresponding
attribute. Transformed_method defines a cooking method for an ingredient if there is a cooking method that is associated with
a particular ingredient. Otherwise, transformed_method is empty. When we defined a set of meat replacements, we created
Ingredients objects and defined cooking methods for each of them. During a transformation, attributes may be overwritten based
on what transformation is called.
